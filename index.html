Loved for its futuristic looks and configurable shade, Louis Weisdorf’s iconic Multi-Lite is one of the most recognizable lighting collections of the 20th century. GUBI’s introduction of the Multi-Lite Portable brought new degrees of versatility to what was already one of the most flexible lamps available. Now, the Muti-Lite Portable becomes more adaptable still, with a range of four new colorways and a striking high-gloss finish, giving the lamp tactility and enabling it to complement an even wider variety of settings, indoors and out. </h2>
